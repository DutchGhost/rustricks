This readme is written to remember some tricks one can do in Rust to accomplish tasks where the solution is not obvious.

### Moving a mutable reference

Lets say you want to assign a mutable slice to a subslice of itself. It currently is impossible to do such a thing 'directly':
```Rust
fn main() {
    let mut array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    let mut view = array.as_mut();

    view = &mut view[2..];

    println!("{:?}", view);
}
```

The borrowchecker complains that `view` is borrowed while assigning to `view`, which violates the borrowing rules.

To get around this, there are 3 options:
  - Use braces `{ }`.
  - Use a function that moves the borrow.
  - Use Non Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)

##### Technique 1: Use braces

```Rust
fn main() {
    let mut array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    let mut view = array.as_mut();

    view = &mut {view}[2..];

    println!("{:?}", view);
}
```

In this case, `view` is first moved into the braces, then indexed, than converted into a mutable slice, and th√†t is reassigned to `view`.

##### Technique 2: Moving the borrow

```Rust
fn mv<T>(x: T) -> T { x }

fn main() {
    let mut array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    let mut view = array.as_mut();

    view = &mut mv(view)[2..];

    println!("{:?}", view);
}
```

In this case, `view` is moved into the `mv` function, then indexed, than converted into a mutable slice, and then `view` is reassigned.

##### Technique 3: Use NLL

```Rust
#![feature(nll)]

fn main() {
    let mut array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    let mut view = array.as_mut();

    view = &mut view[2..];

    println!("{:?}", view);
}
```
